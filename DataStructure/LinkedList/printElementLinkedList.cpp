/*
If you're new to linked lists, this is a great exercise for learning about them. Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list, print its elements in order, one element per line. If the head pointer is null (indicating the list is empty), donâ€™t print anything.

Input Format

The void Print(Node* head) method takes the head node of a linked list as a parameter. Each struct Node has a data field (which stores integer data) and a next field (which points to the next element in the list).

Note: Do not read any input from stdin/console. Each test case calls the Print method individually and passes it the head of a list.

Output Format

Print the integer data for each element of the linked list to stdout/console (e.g.: using printf, cout, etc.). There should be one element per line.

Sample Input

This example uses the following two linked lists:

NULL  
1->2->3->NULL
 and  are the two head nodes passed as arguments to Print(Node* head).

Note: In linked list diagrams, -> describes a pointer to the next node in the list.

Sample Output

1
2
3
